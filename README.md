# Cover Letter Generator
Tired of the same old boring process of writing a cover letter?

### I was too ! 
So I built an AI tool that generates one using your preferences, skills, and experience.
Just answer a few questions, provide your resume and the job ad, andCover-Letter-Generator 
will combine all that information to create the perfect cover letter for you.

### About the program
This is a React frontend project using JSX, with a Node.js/Express backend server. 
For the AI integration, I used Huggiongface's free LLM API (Llama model) and called it 
using fetch endpoint format.

### What to Improve
- I want to find a better LLM API than the one I currently use.
- I can improve the general UI of the project.

### The challenge
I hosted this project on Vercel (a free host that easily connects with GitHub)
but they only work with serverless functions so I needed to restructure my Node.js files. 
It was my first time dealing with that kind of issue so I'm glad it worked out.

# Thanks for taking a look!
